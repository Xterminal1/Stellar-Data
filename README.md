# Stellar Radii
This repo acts as a database folder for collecting stellar radii and spectral classifications for all types of stars, from red dwarfs to RSGs. 
As of 2024, there are two iterations or versions of the collection process.
- Version 1 (1 Apr - 22 Dec 2023)
  - In V1, 447 notable stars, their radii, and spectral classes were listed. Some of the stars listed include white dwarfs, which are technically not considered to be stars.
  - The stellar radii and spectral classes in V1 are from Wikipedia, which is often an inaccurate and inconsistent source. This is improved upon in V2.
  - In V1, many notable RSGs weren't listed, as the primary goal for V1 was to collect radii and spectral classes on regular-sized main-sequence stars.
- Version 2 (ongoing, 5 Jun - )
  - V2 features twice as many notable stars as V1, and it does not include white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, neutron stars, pulsars, magnetars, etc. in the database as they are technically not considered to be stars.
  - Most spectral classes for stars in V2 are from SIMBAD. However, if there is a newer and much more accurate spectral class listed in a source on Wikipedia, then it is used instead of SIMBAD's spectral class for the star.
  - The stellar radii for main-sequence stars dimmer than an apparent magnitude (V) of ~3 come from the Gaia catalogues, specifically DR3 and DR2.
  - Main-sequence stars brighter than ~3V have their radii derived from accurate sources that were available.
  - The stellar radii for stars above ~300 solar radii come from scientific papers for higher precision.

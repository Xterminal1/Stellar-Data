136108 Haumea,"~1,559",Trans-Neptunian object,,"The most accurate semiaxes for Haumea are from Haumea's Shape, Composition, and Internal Structure - IOPscience (a=1050, b=840, c=537). Using the geometric mean method, we can find that the radius of Haumea is cubeRoot(1050*840*537), or ~779.4 km, and the diameter is ~1559 km."

This diameter is estimated by using the ALMA array. The Herschel Space Telescope's estimated diameter for Orcus (958.4km) is likely less accurate because the HST has less spatial resolution and sensitivity than the ALMA."
